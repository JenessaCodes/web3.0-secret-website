### General info

This is an example that showcases the functionality of using Web 3.0 technology to verify a user before entering into a website further.

The project NFT token_id is hardcoded into the source code, but you can test the functionality by supplying your own token_id from a NFT you own.

### Technologies

- HTML5

### Status

Project is: finished.

### Inspiration

Based on the idea of using Opensea API to showcase an account holder's NFTS, but this application serves as a verification system to give access and perks to anyone who holds a special NFT.
